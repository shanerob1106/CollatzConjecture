# Collatz Conjecture
Simple Collatz Conjecture visualization tool. 

# Python

A Python program that can use a single number or a range of numbers to visualize the Collatz Conjecture
The Collatz Conjecture states that for any positive integer n, the following process will eventually reach 1:
 - If n is even, divide it by 2
 - If n is odd, multiply it by 3 and add 1
The program can output the sequence of numbers as text or as a matplotlib.pyplot graph
The user can choose to plot multiple lines for different starting numbers in the same graph
